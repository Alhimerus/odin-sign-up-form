# odin-sign-up-form
In this project I made a simple sign-up form in which I've used css functions, positioning and length units based on viewport. The form is capable of checking if the "password" and "confirm password" inputs contain the same passwords and, in the case of different ones, changes the inputs' border-color to red and shows a div informing the user that the passwords do not match.
